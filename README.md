# So this is the readme section. I will be explaining you the three codes that I did. The 1st one being the BMI calculator. It actually calculates the body mass index. It's as simple as it gets. I took the formula from web and build a basic application where you input your requirement length or the weight. And we just calculated in four different scenarios, for underweight, for good weight, for overweight and for obesity OK. These are the four things that we calculate over there. Next one is the. Password generator here I took 12 digits. So first of all I took a random and I took a. String so that you know we form a string from randomizing the strings and I make a password as a variable and jumbled multiple strings inside it which includes parenthesis everything. With each letters and brackets. Being jumbled for 12. Straight times, which will then guarantee us with a strong password and the last one being. The weather application with the help of HTML and JavaScript. I took the HTML for front end and JavaScript for the front end fetching and used Python for the back end programming which was typically a tough job for me but I did it anyways and although I didn't take any API because it was a new process for me and was getting a lot hectic around here so I thought not putting an API would suggest. What my concerns are regarded, that's all.
